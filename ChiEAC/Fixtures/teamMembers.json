      "member_summary": "My name is Yemilee Monjes Lempa, and I am a proud community builder based in Chicago. Originally from Venezuela, I migrated to the U.S. in 2016, bringing with me a strong spirit of resilience, creativity, and service. I've discovered my calling: to uplift and empower others, especially immigrants and women who are facing difficult circumstances. I believe in the power of community, direct service, and systemic advocacy to create lasting change. My lived experiences allow me to connect deeply with those I serve, and my mission is to build pathways of support, hope, and opportunity. Beyond my dedication to service, I've always held a deep passion for the arts and education. I come from a family of musicians and educators, and before moving to the U.S., I was just one semester away from completing a technical degree in audiovisual communications and photography. I also spent four enriching years studying music practicing violin, voice, and theory at a school for advanced musical education. Today, I serve as an Education Organizer & Resource Manager at Palenque LSNA, where I work to ensure that families and students in our community have the support they need to thrive. I am also an honors student at Northeastern Illinois University, pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Interdisciplinary Studies and a minor in Interaction Design. Looking ahead, I am excited to continue growing in the field of education, combining my lived experience, academic training, and creative background to inspire and support others.",
